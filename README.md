### Development Setup
##### Dependencies
To install all the dependencies you need to run the following command in your terminal: `npm install`

##### Dev server
To run your development server and watcher (to watch all your source code changes), you need to run the following command in your terminal: `webpack-dev-server`

You can then play the game or add to the codebase and see all your changes locally by visiting `http://localhost:8080`

##### Build and deploy
To build the bundled javascript for deployment, you need to run the following command: `webpack`.

To deploy everything in your newly built `build` directory, run the following command: `npm run deploy`
